# SWAT-UQ ( Uncertainty Quantification for SWAT )

**SWAT-UQ:**  
This GUI interface is designed for parameter uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the **SWAT** model. Its Core functionalities are built upon [UQPyL](https://github.com/smasky/UQPyL), our publicly released Python package for UQ. The prime purpose of designing SWAT-UQ is to provide full and easy access to use UQPyL, such as sensitivity analysis, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. Therefore, a key advantage of this program is that users do not need to worry coding; **it seamlessly automates complete workflow from sensitivity analysis to parameter optimization, finally data visualization.**
