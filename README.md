# SWAT-UQ ( Uncertainty Quantification for SWAT )

**SWAT-UQ:**  
This GUI interface is designed for parameter uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the **SWAT** model. Its core functionalities are built upon [UQPyL](https://github.com/smasky/UQPyL), our public released Python package for UQ. The prime purpose of designing SWAT-UQ is to provide full and easy access to combine UQPyL with SWAT, helping users to conduct sensitivity analysis, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. Therefore, a key advantage of this platform is that users do not need to worry about coding; **it seamlessly automates complete workflow from sensitivity analysis to parameter optimization, finally data visualization.**

The SWAT-UQ contains three part of modules corresponding to preparation, execution, and post-processing. 
As **Figure 1** shows, preparation involves **Parameter Setting**, **Objective Define**; Execution includes **Sensibility Analysis**, **Problem Optimization**, **Result Validation & Apply**; Post-processing provide templates for histogram (**Visualization A**) and line chart (**Visualization**).
